                    <h3>Common Themes of User Interviews:</h3>
                    <p>Instant gratification - in terms of the fact that we often seek our own opinion on outfits while out shopping and if it looks good to us we don’t want to wait around for opinions, too inconvenient i.e. especially while in a rush</p>
                    <p>Outfit items/choices are commonly hidden & limited the way our closets are built (most of the people we interviewed don’t have walk-in closets)</p>
                    <p>Time constraints - different times and days of the week often prevent people from picking out exactly what they needed or wanted to wear</p>
                    <p>Comfort over style - some people prioritize what they wear on how comfortable they are in it rather than how it looks on them!</p>

                    <p>Using common knowledge of the traffic light color symbolism, we wanted to tie the evaluation of the item down to 3 states, green for clean to wear, yellow for questionability, and red for needing wash. This would allow users to be able to, from a glance, be able to determine what options were viable.</p>

                    <h1 class="title">Conclusion</h1>
                    <p>We would actually change the shape of the hanger device completely. Instead of our original circular, “collar-like” approach for how the prototype would sit on the hanger, the new revision would be more of a cylinder or rectangular structure, and the device would be significantly smaller. In doing so, this new future revision would give the device a more natural and subtle look on the hanger.</p>
                    <p>Our technology was not designed to change and dictate the user’s life, but rather enhance their lifestyle and enable them to live a more fulfilled experience. By keeping our design philosophy in line with user needs and by limited interaction, we accomplished our design goals and created a product that investors were innterested in.</p>
